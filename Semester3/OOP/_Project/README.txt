You start the timer when you press start, you can practice without timer.
The guess button will update you on progress.
You need to match the boxes with the solution.
Submit your score, time, and name by pressing stop.
Press the back button on solution tab to return to main menu.

Once you are back on the adaptability tab of the main menu you can use the scoreboard.
If you press delete, all will be lost.
When trying to use on an empty scoreboard nothing will happen.
If you search for a user that does not exist you will be notified.

Thank you for playing :)
